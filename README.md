### **Company:**<br>
Citi Bike is a New York City bike share system. It is the nation's largest bike share program with 25.000 bikes and more than 1.500 stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Jersey City, and Hoboken.

### **Project Brief:**<br>
Details of this project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14SaHzdoP2J7gQkHCpVauhnbXB_2H5RzR/view?usp=sharing).

### **Objective:**<br>
This analysis is intended to explore Cite Bike user behavior through advanced analysis. Focuses on correlation/regression analysis, clustering, geographic analysis, and statistical models in machine learning analysis.

### **Data Set:**<br> 
- Title: City Bike Data (September 2013 with original size 50000 rows and 18 columns)
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanmcummings/citi-bike-data).

### **Analysis Questions:**<br>
1. When is the busiest time (hour/day) for users to start biking? 
2. What is the average trip duration for each user category?    
3. Is there a relationship between the start time of the ride and the duration of the ride?
4. Where is the busiest station?

### **Tools:**<br>
For this project, the following Python libraries were used:
- Python
- Seaborn & Matplotlib - For visualization
- Scikit-Learn - For machine learning model and statistic modelling
